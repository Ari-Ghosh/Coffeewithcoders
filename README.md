HTM Project containing both app and web alternatives

Our project here is all about authenticating user and making sure that there are no invalid or unaccounted user our EDTech platform allows all its users to attend pre-recorded lectures, submit assignments and finally keeping track of their records through our dashboard page.

This project is mainly made keeping the scenario of the school that are conducting their class in online or hybrid mode where there are possiblities if invalid and unaccounted entries causing troubles to the teachers and other students that are using the platform seriously.

Our project mainly eliminates the occurences of mal-practices that could be performed by the utilization of the verification barrier that we have inculcated that helps us in segregating a verified user from a non-verified one.

This project hopes to bring a change in the Ed-Tech Platform and making it a more secure place to Study, Learn and Enjoy.


The Web Page for the Ed-Tech Platform can be initialized by running "npm install" in the terminal that installs the node modules and also the .env file has to provide with details as follows:
